Now that my capstone is just about submitted and I've already started working with Flatiron's career counselor, I am one step closer to landing that first job.

Granted, it's not the most amazing time to be looking for a job right now but that is just how life unfolds sometimes!

I've looked for and applied to hundreds of jobs before, but never for something so technical. I definitely have a lot to learn about how to present myself in a more technical fashion, but I'm excited to take all the skills I've learned over the past 5 months and put them to practical use!

Having just completed my final project for Flatiron's Data Science Bootcamp, I have to say - I feel pretty amazing. It was a long journey that was littered with excitement, self-doubt, breakthroughs, breakdowns, and everything in between.

My previous project was on Time Series and I really enjoyed learning about this niche little corner of the Data Science world and it is something that I wanted to continue to explore.

I decided to use an active [Kaggle competition](htthttps://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracyp://) for my dataset. I wanted something that was practical but also relevant.

It was challenging working with a "real world" dataset. Probably the most difficult part, however was trying not to compare myself to others the entire time. With an active competition, there are a lot of smart people posting about a lot of things that I had never heard about so that felt overwhelming at times.

I am definitely planning on expanding upon the work I did. The competition is going for another month and there are a few deep-learning models I would like to learn how to apply to time series.

Cheers to the future in these uncertain times!

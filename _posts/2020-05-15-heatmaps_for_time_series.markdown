Don't get me wrong - making models is a lot of fun and an important part of the data science process. Well, I guess in most cases it's really the *whole point* of a particular data science process.

For me though, I love EDA. I love looking for and finding patterns in the data. Plotting different series together in order to tell a story, exploring various aggregations, combining features, etc. You can tell a whole story from the data with EDA alone. 

One of my favorite things I discovered how to make for time-series models, are heatmaps! They provide a lot of information at a quick glance which is useful when trying to convey information to people who may be non-technical.
